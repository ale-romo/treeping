                    Thank you for your interest in this project. My name is Danielle Dean, and I am a Visual Arts professor at the University of California San Diego. I am working on an exhibition in which I will incorporate responses to this hit within the scope of a larger project related to industry and labor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project studies Fordlandia, a rubber tree plantation in the Amazon, Brazil, which brought in thousands of workers beginning in 1928, offering its citizens utopian promises. Realistically, the workers were faced with unhygienic, sometimes fatal, living and working conditions. What you create here will contribute to a collective film about the relationship between Fordism and modern clickwork, which will be displayed in an upcoming exhibition at an art museum. 
                </p>
